# Session Level Analysis - HPC
**Uncovering Hidden Execution Patterns and Predicting Job Submission in HPC Applications with Session-Based Analysis**  
(Submitted to SC'25)

## Introduction
We are analyzing HPC PBS logs at the session level.  
For the analysis, we used data stored in SQLite3 and utilized libraries such as Polars, Plotly, and Altair.  
The method for grouping jobs into sessions was inspired by concepts from web log analysis.  
  
Our analysis uncovers hidden execution patterns and enables the prediction of job submission times in HPC applications.
